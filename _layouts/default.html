    Tickle, Slap, Punch by Rob Guarino April, 2022 for The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors challenge.
Thank you to all contributors to TOP for maintaining a free and practical beginner outreach to programming.
Thanks as well to all individual knowledge sharers and those found in communities such as StackOverflow and
W3Schools. That's just to say they've all helped me in some way to push through what I did not understand.
All shortcomings of this code are my own but satisfy the scope of this project, from which I look forward to improve.
Special thanks to 'Wet Bulb Temperature' for their timer tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRdCCVGuqHc
